  ## [Description](#table-of-contents)

  This project helps a social media startup create an API that's able to handle large amounts of unstructured data.

  I created this project to help a social media start up company create an API so that way they start storing user and thought data.

  The social media start up will create a front end that'll communicate with the back end database to pull user information to create a pleasurable UI for users.

  ## [Installation](#table-of-contents)

  Click the repository link below. Download the zip file and copy it to a directory of your choice or clone to a directory of your choice using your terminal.  Open the file in VS Code or whatever editor you work with. Open the terminal in VS Code and make sure youâ€™re in the root directory 'challenge-18-social-network-api'. You'll be ready to run the app! You can use the ZIP file download and Git Clone download tutorials below from another project for help. It works the exact same way.

  ## [Usage](#table-of-contents)

  After installation is complete, run the following code `npm install` in the terminal. This will download all of the applicable npm packages needed to run the app. After the packages are installed, run `npm run dev` in the terminal to start the server. You'll now be good to test the routes in Insomnia
